# Rust String Libraries by mcyoung

For some reason or another, I keep accumulating libraries for operating on
strings of data. Rather than continue to generate disparate repos, this one repo
will hold all of my strings libraries, which will make it easier for them to
depend on each other.

## Table of Contents

- 📜 [`buf-trait`](https://github.com/mcy/strings/tree/main/buf-trait) - A trait
  for abstracting over buffers of POD data.

- 🧶 [`byteyarn`](https://github.com/mcy/strings/tree/main/byteyarn) -
  Space-efficient byte strings.

- 🌲 [`twie`](https://github.com/mcy/strings/tree/main/twie) - Fast and compact
  prefix tries.

- ⛩️ [`ilex`](https://github.com/mcy/strings/tree/main/ilex) - The last lexer I
  ever want to write.

- 🗒️ [`allman`](https://github.com/mcy/strings/tree/main/allman) - A DOM for
  code formatters.

- 👑 [`gilded`](https://github.com/mcy/strings/tree/main/gilded) - How I learned
  to stop worrying and love golden testing.

- 💢 [`proc2decl`](https://github.com/mcy/strings/tree/main/proc2decl) - Proc
  macros suck!
